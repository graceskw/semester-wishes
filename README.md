# semester-wishes

At the start of each semester, I try to make a little something for my companions to wish them good luck. In semester 2 of 2023-2024, however, a hand injury prevented me from doing arts and craft as usual, but that certainly did not stop me. I had the idea of translating my crafts into its digital copy, wishing my pals that they can 過三爆四 (having desirable GPA) in this semester!\
